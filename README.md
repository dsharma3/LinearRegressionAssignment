## General Information
- This analysis is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Below is the equation that get formed for linear regression, after doing all the model fitment.
- cnt = temp + yr - weathersit_3


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- sklearn
- statsmodel

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
